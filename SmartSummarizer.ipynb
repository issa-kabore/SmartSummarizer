If a subtitle file is provided, it should be of type .srt or .vtt. Or can be callable, in which case the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.\n",
      "     |          format: the file extension with which to save video, such as 'avi' or 'mp4'. This parameter applies both when this component is used as an input to determine which file format to convert user-provided video to, and when this component is used as an output to determine the format of video returned to the user. If None, no file format conversion is done and the video is kept as is. Use 'mp4' to ensure browser playability.\n",
      "     |          sources: list of sources permitted for video. \"upload\" creates a box where user can drop a video file, \"webcam\" allows user to record a video from their webcam. If None, defaults to both [\"upload, \"webcam\"].\n",
      "     |          height: The height of the component, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units if a string is passed. This has no effect on the preprocessed video file, but will affect the displayed video.\n",
      "     |          width: The width of the component, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units if a string is passed. This has no effect on the preprocessed video file, but will affect the displayed video.\n",
      "     |          label: the label for this component. Appears above the component and is also used as the header if there are a table of examples for this component. If None and used in a `gr.Interface`, the label will be the name of the parameter this component is assigned to.\n",
      "     |          every: continously calls `value` to recalculate it if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). Can provide a Timer whose tick resets `value`, or a float that provides the regular interval for the reset Timer.\n",
      "     |          inputs: components that are used as inputs to calculate `value` if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). `value` is recalculated any time the inputs change.\n",

      "     |          container: if True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.\n",
      "     |          scale: relative size compared to adjacent Components. For example if Components A and B are in a Row, and A has scale=2, and B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer. scale applies in Rows, and to top-level Components in Blocks where fill_height=True.\n",
      "     |          min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.\n",
      "     |          interactive: if True, will allow users to upload a video; if False, can only be used to display videos. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.\n",

      "     |          render: if False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.\n",
      "     |          key: if assigned, will be used to assume identity across a re-render. Components that have the same key across a re-render will have their value preserved.\n",
      "     |          include_audio: whether the component should record/retain the audio track for a video. By default, audio is excluded for webcam videos and included for uploaded videos.\n",
      "     |          autoplay: whether to automatically play the video when the component is used as an output. Note: browsers will not autoplay video files if the user has not interacted with the page yet.\n",
      "     |          show_share_button: if True, will show a share icon in the corner of the component that allows user to share outputs to Hugging Face Spaces Discussions. If False, icon does not appear. If set to None (default behavior), then the icon appears if this Gradio app is launched on Spaces, but not otherwise.\n",
      "     |          show_download_button: if True, will show a download icon in the corner of the component that allows user to download the output. If False, icon does not appear. By default, it will be True for output components and False for input components.\n",
      "     |          min_length: the minimum length of video (in seconds) that the user can pass into the prediction function. If None, there is no minimum length.\n",
      "     |          max_length: the maximum length of video (in seconds) that the user can pass into the prediction function. If None, there is no maximum length.\n",
      "     |          loop: if True, the video will loop when it reaches the end and continue playing from the beginning.\n",
      "     |          streaming: when used set as an output, takes video chunks yielded from the backend and combines them into one streaming video output. Each chunk should be a video file with a .ts extension using an h.264 encoding. Mp4 files are also accepted but they will be converted to h.264 encoding.\n",
      "     |          watermark: an image file to be included as a watermark on the video. The image is not scaled and is displayed on the bottom right of the video. Valid formats for the image are: jpeg, png.\n",
      "     |          webcam_options: A `gr.WebcamOptions` instance that allows developers to specify custom media constraints for the webcam stream. This parameter provides flexibility to control the video stream's properties, such as resolution and front or rear camera on mobile devices. See $demo/webcam_constraints\n",

      " |      Parameters:\n",
      " |          fn: the function to wrap an interface around. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.\n",
      " |          inputs: a single Gradio component, or list of Gradio components. Components can either be passed as instantiated objects, or referred to by their string shortcuts. The number of input components should match the number of parameters in fn. If set to None, then only the output components will be displayed.\n",
      " |          outputs: a single Gradio component, or list of Gradio components. Components can either be passed as instantiated objects, or referred to by their string shortcuts. The number of output components should match the number of values returned by fn. If set to None, then only the input components will be displayed.\n",
      " |          examples: sample inputs for the function; if provided, appear below the UI components and can be clicked to populate the interface. Should be nested list, in which the outer list consists of samples and each inner list consists of an input corresponding to each input component. A string path to a directory of examples can also be provided, but it should be within the directory with the python file running the gradio app. If there are multiple input components and a directory is provided, a log.csv file must be present in the directory to link corresponding inputs.\n",
      " |          cache_examples: If True, caches examples in the server for fast runtime in examples. If \"lazy\", then examples are cached (for all users of the app) after their first use (by any user of the app). If None, will use the GRADIO_CACHE_EXAMPLES environment variable, which should be either \"true\" or \"false\". In HuggingFace Spaces, this parameter defaults to True (as long as `fn` and `outputs` are also provided).\n",
      " |          cache_mode: if \"lazy\", examples are cached after their first use. If \"eager\", all examples are cached at app launch. If None, will use the GRADIO_CACHE_MODE environment variable if defined, or default to \"eager\". In HuggingFace Spaces, this parameter defaults to \"eager\" except for ZeroGPU Spaces, in which case it defaults to \"lazy\".\n",
      " |          examples_per_page: if examples are provided, how many to display per page.\n",
      " |          live: whether the interface should automatically rerun if any of the inputs change.\n",
      " |          title: a title for the interface; if provided, appears above the input and output components in large font. Also used as the tab title when opened in a browser window.\n",
      " |          description: a description for the interface; if provided, appears above the input and output components and beneath the title in regular font. Accepts Markdown and HTML content.\n",
      " |          article: an expanded article explaining the interface; if provided, appears below the input and output components in regular font. Accepts Markdown and HTML content. If it is an HTTP(S) link to a downloadable remote file, the content of this file is displayed.\n",
      " |          theme: a Theme object or a string representing a theme. If a string, will look for a built-in theme with that name (e.g. \"soft\" or \"default\"), or will attempt to load a theme from the Hugging Face Hub (e.g. \"gradio/monochrome\"). If None, will use the Default theme.\n",
      " |          flagging_mode: one of \"never\", \"auto\", or \"manual\". If \"never\" or \"auto\", users will not see a button to flag an input and output. If \"manual\", users will see a button to flag. If \"auto\", every input the user submits will be automatically flagged, along with the generated output. If \"manual\", both the input and outputs are flagged when the user clicks flag button. This parameter can be set with environmental variable GRADIO_FLAGGING_MODE; otherwise defaults to \"manual\".\n",
      " |          flagging_options: if provided, allows user to select from the list of options when flagging. Only applies if flagging_mode is \"manual\". Can either be a list of tuples of the form (label, value), where label is the string that will be displayed on the button and value is the string that will be stored in the flagging CSV; or it can be a list of strings [\"X\", \"Y\"], in which case the values will be the list of strings and the labels will [\"Flag as X\", \"Flag as Y\"], etc.\n",
      " |          flagging_dir: path to the the directory where flagged data is stored. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.\n",
      " |          flagging_callback: either None or an instance of a subclass of FlaggingCallback which will be called when a sample is flagged. If set to None, an instance of gradio.flagging.CSVLogger will be created and logs will be saved to a local CSV file in flagging_dir. Default to None.\n",
      " |          analytics_enabled: whether to allow basic telemetry. If None, will use GRADIO_ANALYTICS_ENABLED environment variable if defined, or default to True.\n",
      " |          batch: if True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.\n",
      " |          max_batch_size: the maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)\n",
      " |          api_name: defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the API docs with the given name. If None, the name of the prediction function will be used as the API endpoint. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the API docs and downstream apps (including those that `gr.load` this app) will not be able to use this event.\n",
      " |          allow_duplication: if True, then will show a 'Duplicate Spaces' button on Hugging Face Spaces.\n",
      " |          concurrency_limit: if set, this is the maximum number of this event that can be running simultaneously. Can be set to None to mean no concurrency_limit (any number of this event can be running simultaneously). Set to \"default\" to use the default concurrency limit (defined by the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter in `.queue()`, which itself is 1 by default).\n",
      " |          css: Custom css as a code string. This css will be included in the demo webpage.\n",
      " |          css_paths: Custom css as a pathlib.Path to a css file or a list of such paths. This css files will be read, concatenated, and included in the demo webpage. If the `css` parameter is also set, the css from `css` will be included first.\n",
      " |          js: Custom js as a code string. The custom js should be in the form of a single js function. This function will automatically be executed when the page loads. For more flexibility, use the head parameter to insert js inside <script> tags.\n",
      " |          head: Custom html code to insert into the head of the demo webpage. This can be used to add custom meta tags, multiple scripts, stylesheets, etc. to the page.\n",
      " |          head_paths: Custom html code as a pathlib.Path to a html file or a list of such paths. This html files will be read, concatenated, and included in the head of the demo webpage. If the `head` parameter is also set, the html from `head` will be included first.\n",
      " |          additional_inputs: a single Gradio component, or list of Gradio components. Components can either be passed as instantiated objects, or referred to by their string shortcuts. These components will be rendered in an accordion below the main input components. By default, no additional input components will be displayed.\n",
      " |          additional_inputs_accordion: if a string is provided, this is the label of the `gr.Accordion` to use to contain additional inputs. A `gr.Accordion` object can be provided as well to configure other properties of the container holding the additional inputs. Defaults to a `gr.Accordion(label=\"Additional Inputs\", open=False)`. This parameter is only used if `additional_inputs` is provided.\n",
      " |          submit_btn: the button to use for submitting inputs. Defaults to a `gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")`. This parameter does not apply if the Interface is output-only, in which case the submit button always displays \"Generate\". Can be set to a string (which becomes the button label) or a `gr.Button` object (which allows for more customization).\n",
      " |          stop_btn: the button to use for stopping the interface. Defaults to a `gr.Button(\"Stop\", variant=\"stop\", visible=False)`. Can be set to a string (which becomes the button label) or a `gr.Button` object (which allows for more customization).\n",
      " |          clear_btn: the button to use for clearing the inputs. Defaults to a `gr.Button(\"Clear\", variant=\"secondary\")`. Can be set to a string (which becomes the button label) or a `gr.Button` object (which allows for more customization). Can be set to None, which hides the button.\n",
      " |          delete_cache: a tuple corresponding [frequency, age] both expressed in number of seconds. Every `frequency` seconds, the temporary files created by this Blocks instance will be deleted if more than `age` seconds have passed since the file was created. For example, setting this to (86400, 86400) will delete temporary files every day. The cache will be deleted entirely when the server restarts. If None, no cache deletion will occur.\n",
      " |          show_progress: how to show the progress animation while event is running: \"full\" shows a spinner which covers the output component area as well as a runtime display in the upper right corner, \"minimal\" only shows the runtime display, \"hidden\" shows no progress animation at all\n",
      " |          example_labels: a list of labels for each example. If provided, the length of this list should be the same as the number of examples, and these labels will be used in the UI instead of rendering the example values.\n",
      " |          fill_width: whether to horizontally expand to fill container fully. If False, centers and constrains app to a maximum width.\n",
      " |          time_limit: The time limit for the stream to run. Default is 30 seconds. Parameter only used for streaming images or audio if the interface is live and the input components are set to \"streaming=True\".\n",
      " |          stream_every: The latency (in seconds) at which stream chunks are sent to the backend. Defaults to 0.5 seconds. Parameter only used for streaming images or audio if the interface is live and the input components are set to \"streaming=True\".\n",
      " |          deep_link: a string or `gr.DeepLinkButton` object that creates a unique URL you can use to share your app and all components **as they currently are** with others. Automatically enabled on Hugging Face Spaces unless explicitly set to False.\n",

Le premier document concerne la gestion des ressources humaines, et le second porte sur l'optimisation des processus logistiques pour améliorer l'efficacité des opérations de transport. Les deux documents contiennent des informations clés sur les changements organisationnels que nous avons mis en place récemment. La réunion d'aujourd'hui permettra de discuter de ces points et de prendre des décisions éclairées sur la direction future de notre entreprise. Nous avons besoin d'un résumé clair et précis des principaux changements et recommandations. Merci de prêter attention aux détails les plus importants.\"\"\",\n",

    "            \"\"\"This is a long English article that explains how machine learning models are trained using large datasets. Machine learning involves the development of algorithms that can process and analyze data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In this article, we will explore the different stages involved in training a machine learning model, starting with data collection, followed by data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and finally, model training and evaluation. Each of these steps is crucial for building a high-performance machine learning model. We will also discuss some of the challenges faced during the training process, such as overfitting and underfitting, and how to mitigate them using techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization. The goal is to help readers understand the entire process of model training and to provide insights into the best practices used in the industry.\"\"\",\n",
